# Azure WAF Attack Testing Lab Environment Deployment Template
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Network-Security%2Fmaster%2FAzure%2520WAF%2FTemplate%2520-%2520WAF%2520Attack%2520Testing%2520Lab%2520template%2FAzNetSecdeploy_Juice-Shop_AZFW-Rules_Updated.json)


This ARM deployment includes everything needed to test Azure WAF Security components.  Below are the differences from the default Azure Network Security deployment template.

- A custom Docker image with a modified version of the OWASP Juice Shop application
- Built-in Azure Firewall rules to allow inbound and outbound connectivity for the Kali VM

This [blogpost](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-network-security-blog/part-1-lab-setup-azure-waf-security-protection-and-detection-lab/ba-p/2030469) provides additional guidance into how this lab works and testing out WAF attack scenarios. 

**Original Azure Network Security deployment template:**

## PowerShell Deployment Example:

Please use this location as a reference how this powershell commandlet works: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell#deploy-remote-template

There are 6 parameters with defaults
* DefaultUserName
* DefaultPassword
* DiagnosticsWorkspaceName
* DiagnosticsWorkspaceSubscription
* DiagnosticsWorkspaceResourceGroup
* DDOSProtectionConfiguration (bool) - true by default

Adding some `samples` to give context
- Subscription ID : "12345678-1234-1234-1234-b826eef6c592"
- Log Analyitcs Workspace name: "TestWorkspace"
- Resource Group Log Analytics workspace is in: "TestResourceGroup"

**Example Powershell command with some parameters configured:**
>New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName DeleteMe1 -TemplateUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Network-Security/master/Azure%20WAF/ARM%20Template%20-%20WAF%20Attack%20Testing%20Lab/AzNetSecdeploy_Juice-Shop_AZFW-Rules_Updated.json -DiagnosticsWorkspaceName "TestWorkspace" -DiagnosticsWorkspaceSubscription "12345678-1234-1234-1234-b826eef6c592" -DiagnosticsWorkspaceResourceGroup "TestResourceGroup" -DDOSProtectionConfiguration $true
